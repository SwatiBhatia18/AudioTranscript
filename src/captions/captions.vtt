Arthur the Rat read by Brian Goggin from

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.850
Ireland Once there was a young rat named

3
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.470
Arthur who could never make up his mind.

4
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.230
Whenever his friends asked him if he would

5
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:09.570
like to go out with them, he would

6
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.690
only answer, I don't know.

7
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.570
He wouldn't say yes or no, either.

8
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.290
He would always shirk, making a choice.

9
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.510
His aunt Helen said to him, Now look

10
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.730
here, no one is going to care for you if you carry on like this. You have no more mind than a bade of grass.

11
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.790


12
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.530
You have no more mind than a bade

13
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:20.970
of grass.

14
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.530
One rainy day the rats heard a great

15
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.290
noise in the loft. The pine rafters were all rotten, so the barn was rather unsafe. At last the joists gave way and fell to the ground. The walls shook and all the rats' hair


21
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.570
stood on end with fear and horror. This won't do, said the captain. I'll send out scouts to search for a new home. Within five hours the ten scouts came back and said, We found a stone house where there is room and board for us all.

28
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.150
There is a kindly horse named Nelly, a cow, a calf and a garden with an elm tree. The rats crawled out of their little houses and stood on the floor in a long line. Just then the old one saw Arthur. Stop, he ordered coarsely. You are coming, of course. I am not certain, said Arthur undaunted. The roof may not come down yet.

39
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.330
Well, said the angry old rat, we can't

40
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.250
wait for you to join us.

41
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.090
Right about face!

42
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:04.510
March!

43
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.390
Arthur stood and watched them hurry away.

44
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.250
I think I'll go tomorrow, he calmly said

45
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.630
to himself.

46
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.810
But then again, I don't know.

47
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.910
It's so nice and snug here.

48
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.790
That night there was a big crash.

49
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.650
In the morning some men with some boys

50
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.870
and girls rode up and looked at the

51
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:17.070
barn.

52
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.710
One of them moved aboard and he saw

53
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.670
a young rat, quite dead, half in and

54
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.590
half out of his hole.

55
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.250
Thus the shirker got his due.
